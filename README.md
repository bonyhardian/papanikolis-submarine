=====================

Papanikolis Submarine is a racing/arcade game set in a 2D environment. It is influenced by the game ThrottleCopter meaning that it resembles ThrottleCopter's gameplay and philosophy. The game can be played in two modes: Singleplayer and Multiplayer (1 vs 1) via Bluetooth. The targeted hardware is any mobile device running Android (smartphones, tablets).

The player is the captain of a submarine and his task is to guide/drive the submarine safely inside a sea tunnel. The player tries to keep the submarine as far in the sea tunnel as possible without crashing on any obstacle. As soon as the submarine touches an obstacle or any of the surfaces of the tunnel the game will be over. The main motivation for the player is to achieve the highest possible score which is measured as the distance traveled in the tunnel.

How to play: Touch screen to ascend, release to descend.
